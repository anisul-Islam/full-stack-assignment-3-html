            <p>
                Hello, I am Md. Aminul Islam. Professionally I am a CS student. And I
                want to base myself as a computer engineer. So I have so much knowledge
                about Development and other works.<br />
                <br />
                In terms of technical skills, Developers are proficient in programming
                languages such as HTML, CSS, C Programming, C++, and JavaScript, as well
                as various frameworks and tools used for Development progress. I have a
                deep understanding of web design principles, user experience, and web
                performance optimization techniques.<br />
                <br />
                I am also highly detail-oriented and have a strong problem-solving
                mindset. I am able to analyze complex problems and develop effective
                solutions in a timely manner. I am comfortable working independently or
                as part of a team and am able to communicate effectively with both
                technical and non-technical stakeholders.<br />
                <br />
                In terms of work experience, Developers may have experience in front-end
                development, back-end development, or full-stack development, depending
                on their areas of expertise. I have experience working with various
                content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and other Development
                tools.<br />
                <br />
                Overall, I am passionate about my work, stay up-to-date with the latest
                trends and technologies, and am dedicated to delivering high-quality,
                user-friendly web solutions that meet the needs of my clients and
                users.<br />

                <p>
                    <b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language
                    for creating web pages
                </p>
                <li>
                    <b>Basic Structure:</b> You start with the basic structure of an
                    HTML document which includes <b>!DOCTYPE html</b>, <b>html</b>,
                    <b>head</b>, and <b>p</b> tags. This sets up the framework of your
                    webpage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Adding Content:</b> Within the body, you add various elements
                    such as headings <b>(h1 to h6)</b>, <b>paragraphs (p)</b>,
                    <b>links (a)</b>, <b>images (img)</b>, <b>lists (ul, ol, li)</b> and
                    more. Each element is defined by a tag and can have attributes to
                    provide additional information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Styling:</b> Although HTML focuses on structure and content, you
                    can add basic styling directly using the style attribute or link to
                    external CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files for more sophisticated
                    design.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Interactivity:</b> HTML alone isn't enough for interactivity, but
                    you can incorporate JavaScript to add dynamic behavior to your web
                    pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Validation and Accessibility:</b> Ensuring your HTML is valid
                    (using validators) and accessible (using proper semantics and ARIA
                    roles) is crucial for a good user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Development Tools:</b> Modern development environments and
                    browser tools help in writing, debugging, and refining HTML code
                    efficiently.

            <p>As a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student, my journey has been a mix of academic challenges and
                hands-on experiences. In the first year, I learned programming basics, spending hours debugging code and
                feeling accomplished when it worked. The second year I will introduced more complex subjects like Data
                Structures and Algorithms, with projects such as developing a mini-database system. The third year will
                be allowed for specialization in areas like Artificial Intelligence and Web Development, involving team
                projects and practical application of skills.<br>
                <br>
                Internships provided real-world experience, teaching me agile development, code maintenance, and
                troubleshooting. The final year will focused on a capstone project, where my team developed an AI-based
                recommendation system, showcasing our comprehensive learning. Beyond academics, participating in
                hackathons and tech clubs honed my coding skills and built a strong peer network.<br>
                <br>
                Overall, the combination of theoretical knowledge, practical projects, and extracurricular activities
                will prepare me well for a career in the tech industry, equipped to tackle real-world challenges.<br>
